      "[\"xi \\n \\nCHAPTER 1 \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe term 'refrigeration may be defined as the process of removing heat from a substance \\nunder controlled conditions. It also includes the process of reducing and maintaining \\nthe temperature of a body below the general temperature of its surroundings In other \\nwords, the refrigeration means a continued extraction of heat from a body whose \\ntemperature is already below temperature of its surroundings. In a refrigerator, heat is \\nvirtually pumped from a lower temperature to a higher temperature According to \\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics, this process can only be performed with the aid of \\nsome external work It is thus obvious that supply of power is regularly required to drive \\na refrigerator Theoretically, a refrigerator is a reversed heat engine or a heat pump \\nwhich pumps heat from a cold body and delivers it to a hot body. The substance which \\nworks in a pump to extract heat from a cold body and to deliver it to a hot body is \\nknown as refrigerant. \\nRefrigeration cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that explains the processes required for \\nproduction of refrigeration. There are various refrigeration cycles \\n1. Air refrigeration cycle \\n    (a) Reversed Camot cycle (most efficient cycle)  \\n    (b) Bell-Coleman cycle (modified Camot cycle for practical) \\n2. Vapour refrigeration cycle \\n3. Steam-jet refrigeration cycle \\nTo provide the refrigeration there are various refrigeration systems are improved \\nworking with above refrigeration cycles. In different types of the refrigeration systems, \\nsome physical property of matter is used for producing cold.In vapour refrigeration \\nsystem instead of air, vapour like ammonia, carbon dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is used as \\nworking fluids. The vapour refrigeration system works on the reversed cycle which is \\nused for steam power plants. The pump in the steam power plant is replaced by the \\nthrottle valve, boiler is replaced by a refrigerator and the turbine is replaced a \\ncompressor.\", \"xiii \\n \\nand practical form of refrigeration system for domestic and commercial utility. The \\nworking (refrigerants) used is Ammonia, carbon dioxide. Freons, etc and these fluids \\nhave the characteristic ability to change alternately between the vapour and liquid \\nphases without leaving the plant. \\nThe vapour refrigeration systems now-a-days are universally used for all purpose \\nrefrigeration. The vapour refrigeration systems are being used for the last 100 years but \\nwith the development in design of compressors and an increase in their speed has \\nincreased its economy from the last few decades only. It is generally used for all \\nindustrial purposes from a small domestic unit of 0.5-ton capacity to an air-conditioning \\nplant of cinema hall of 200 tons capacity  \\nVCRS are an efficient method of moving energy around. There are utilized in the \\nmajority of refrigerators, freezers and air conditioning systems produced today. They \\nalso have practical applications as \\\"heat pumps\\\" a term describing an electrically \\npowered VCRS to heat an enclosed space such as your home by transferring heat energy \\nfrom outside to the inside. Imagine an inside out refrigerator. They also have the \\npotential to be run \\\"backwards\\\", producing electricity. In this form low grade heat \\nenergy, such as solar thermal, is put in to the evaporator side and electrical energy is \\ntaken out from a turbine or reciprocating engine replacing the compressor. \\n \\n \\n1.1 \\nTHEORY \\nOF \\nSIMPLE \\nVAPOUR \\nCOMPRESSION \\nREFRIGERATION SYSTEM:\", \"xii \\n \\nThe heat carried away by the air from the refrigerator in the air refrigeration system is \\nin the form of sensible heat as there is no change of phase so that the effectiveness of \\nthe air refrigeration system is less. In a vapour refrigeration system heat carried away \\nby the vapour in the refrigerator is in the form latent heat of refrigerant so that the \\ncapacity of refrigeration of vapour refrigeration system per kg of refrigerant is far \\nsuperior than the air refrigeration system. \\nThe vapour refrigeration system is sub divided into two types \\n   (a) Vapour compression refrigeration system \\n   (b) Vapour absorption refrigeration system \\nThe difference between these two is in the manner in which external heat is added to \\nthe vaporized refrigerant to increase its thermal level above atmosphere which is \\nnecessary to reject the heat in the condenser. In case of vapour compression \\nrefrigeration system, the refrigerant vapour is sucked into the compressor and is \\ncompressed adding the energy in the form of work to increase its thermal level above \\natmosphere. In case of absorption refrigeration system, a working fluid (refrigerant) is \\ntaken which has high affinity to dissolve in water. The refrigerant which is commonly \\nused in absorption refrigeration system is ammonia. The liquid, strong in ammonia, is \\nheated further by the application of external heat to generate vapour and its temperature \\nis increased above atmospheric temperature. \\nVapour compression cycle is an improved type of air refrigeration cycle in which a \\nworking substance (other than the air), termed as refrigerant, is used. The refrigerants \\ngenerally used for purpose are ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur-\\ndioxide (SO2) for industrial and Freon (HFC R134a) for domestic refrigeration. The \\nrefrigerant used, does not leave the system, but is circulated throughout the system \\nalternately condensing and evaporating. In evaporating, the refrigerant absorbs its latent \\nheat from the solution which is used for circulating it. around the cold chamber and in \\ncondensing; it gives out its latent heat to the circulating water of the cooler. The vapour \\ncompression cycle which is used in vapour compression refrigeration system is now-a-\\ndays used for all purpose refrigeration. It is used for all industrial purposes from a small \\ndomestic refrigerator to a big air conditioning plant Vapour compression refrigeration \\nsystem is a system which is used to transfer heat from low temperature reservoir to high \\ntemperature reservoir with the help of refrigerant. This system is the most important\", \"xx \\n \\n \\n1.5 CONDITIONS FOR HIGHEST COP \\nBetter performance of a refrigeration system is defined as higher COP of the system \\nThe COP of the system be increased either by decreasing the compression work or \\nincreasing the refrigerating effect or both. \\nCompression work of the system can be greatly reduced by compressing the refrigerant \\nvery close to the vapour saturation line. This can be achieved by compressing the \\nrefrigerant in more stages with intermediate inter-coolers. The refrigerating effect can \\nbe increased by maintaining the condition of refrigerant in more liquid state at the \\nentrance of evaporator. This can be achieved by expanding the refrigerant very close to \\nthe liquid line By sub-cooling the refrigerant and by removing the flashed vapour, the \\nexpansion can be brought close to the liquid line. \\n1.5.1 Effect of Evaporator Pressure \\nConsider a simple saturation cycle 1-2-3-4 with Freon 12 as the refrigerant as shown in \\nFigure for operating conditions of tc=40°C and to te=-5°C. Now consider a change in \\nthe evaporator pressure corresponding to a decrease in the evaporator temperature to -\\n10°C. The changed cycle is shown as 1'-2'-3'-4' in figure. \\n \\nFig.1.5 Effect of evaporator pressure \\nIt is therefore, seen that a drop in evaporator pressure corresponding to a drop of 5°C \\nin saturated suction temperature increases the volume of suction vapour and hence \\ndecreases the capacity of a reciprocating compressor and increases the power \\nconsumption per unit refrigeration.\"]\n",

      "[\"xi \\n \\nCHAPTER 1 \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe term 'refrigeration may be defined as the process of removing heat from a substance \\nunder controlled conditions. It also includes the process of reducing and maintaining \\nthe temperature of a body below the general temperature of its surroundings In other \\nwords, the refrigeration means a continued extraction of heat from a body whose \\ntemperature is already below temperature of its surroundings. In a refrigerator, heat is \\nvirtually pumped from a lower temperature to a higher temperature According to \\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics, this process can only be performed with the aid of \\nsome external work It is thus obvious that supply of power is regularly required to drive \\na refrigerator Theoretically, a refrigerator is a reversed heat engine or a heat pump \\nwhich pumps heat from a cold body and delivers it to a hot body. The substance which \\nworks in a pump to extract heat from a cold body and to deliver it to a hot body is \\nknown as refrigerant. \\nRefrigeration cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that explains the processes required for \\nproduction of refrigeration. There are various refrigeration cycles \\n1. Air refrigeration cycle \\n    (a) Reversed Camot cycle (most efficient cycle)  \\n    (b) Bell-Coleman cycle (modified Camot cycle for practical) \\n2. Vapour refrigeration cycle \\n3. Steam-jet refrigeration cycle \\nTo provide the refrigeration there are various refrigeration systems are improved \\nworking with above refrigeration cycles. In different types of the refrigeration systems, \\nsome physical property of matter is used for producing cold.In vapour refrigeration \\nsystem instead of air, vapour like ammonia, carbon dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is used as \\nworking fluids. The vapour refrigeration system works on the reversed cycle which is \\nused for steam power plants. The pump in the steam power plant is replaced by the \\nthrottle valve, boiler is replaced by a refrigerator and the turbine is replaced a \\ncompressor.\", \"xiii \\n \\nand practical form of refrigeration system for domestic and commercial utility. The \\nworking (refrigerants) used is Ammonia, carbon dioxide. Freons, etc and these fluids \\nhave the characteristic ability to change alternately between the vapour and liquid \\nphases without leaving the plant. \\nThe vapour refrigeration systems now-a-days are universally used for all purpose \\nrefrigeration. The vapour refrigeration systems are being used for the last 100 years but \\nwith the development in design of compressors and an increase in their speed has \\nincreased its economy from the last few decades only. It is generally used for all \\nindustrial purposes from a small domestic unit of 0.5-ton capacity to an air-conditioning \\nplant of cinema hall of 200 tons capacity  \\nVCRS are an efficient method of moving energy around. There are utilized in the \\nmajority of refrigerators, freezers and air conditioning systems produced today. They \\nalso have practical applications as \\\"heat pumps\\\" a term describing an electrically \\npowered VCRS to heat an enclosed space such as your home by transferring heat energy \\nfrom outside to the inside. Imagine an inside out refrigerator. They also have the \\npotential to be run \\\"backwards\\\", producing electricity. In this form low grade heat \\nenergy, such as solar thermal, is put in to the evaporator side and electrical energy is \\ntaken out from a turbine or reciprocating engine replacing the compressor. \\n \\n \\n1.1 \\nTHEORY \\nOF \\nSIMPLE \\nVAPOUR \\nCOMPRESSION \\nREFRIGERATION SYSTEM:\", \"xxxiii \\n \\n Comparison \\n3.1 EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES \\nTo study the performance of vapour compression refrigeration system we selected the \\ndomestic refrigerating unit. In general, it is called as refrigerator or fridge. Refrigerator \\nis the one of the major domestic appliances. Refrigerator consists of hermetic \\ncompressor, wire and tube condenser, filter, capillary tube and evaporator coil. There \\nare various researches have been conducted to improve the COP of the system. There \\nis a general opinion at the researchers that to improve the COP of the system, the four \\ncomponents of the system should work at their maximum possible \\nThe following figure shows the domestic refrigerator, detailing different compartments \\naccording to the present domestic requirements.  \\n \\nFig.3.1. Refrigerator \\nTo calculate the COP of the refrigerator pressures and temperatures must be known. \\nHence, pressure gauges and temperature indicators have to be placed at certain positions \\nin the system. There is the necessary to make the test rig to evaluate the performance. \\n3.1.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\", \"xx \\n \\n \\n1.5 CONDITIONS FOR HIGHEST COP \\nBetter performance of a refrigeration system is defined as higher COP of the system \\nThe COP of the system be increased either by decreasing the compression work or \\nincreasing the refrigerating effect or both. \\nCompression work of the system can be greatly reduced by compressing the refrigerant \\nvery close to the vapour saturation line. This can be achieved by compressing the \\nrefrigerant in more stages with intermediate inter-coolers. The refrigerating effect can \\nbe increased by maintaining the condition of refrigerant in more liquid state at the \\nentrance of evaporator. This can be achieved by expanding the refrigerant very close to \\nthe liquid line By sub-cooling the refrigerant and by removing the flashed vapour, the \\nexpansion can be brought close to the liquid line. \\n1.5.1 Effect of Evaporator Pressure \\nConsider a simple saturation cycle 1-2-3-4 with Freon 12 as the refrigerant as shown in \\nFigure for operating conditions of tc=40°C and to te=-5°C. Now consider a change in \\nthe evaporator pressure corresponding to a decrease in the evaporator temperature to -\\n10°C. The changed cycle is shown as 1'-2'-3'-4' in figure. \\n \\nFig.1.5 Effect of evaporator pressure \\nIt is therefore, seen that a drop in evaporator pressure corresponding to a drop of 5°C \\nin saturated suction temperature increases the volume of suction vapour and hence \\ndecreases the capacity of a reciprocating compressor and increases the power \\nconsumption per unit refrigeration.\"]\n",
